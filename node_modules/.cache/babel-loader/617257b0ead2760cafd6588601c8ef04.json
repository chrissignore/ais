We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to identify that you’ve logged in to the Services and to tell us how and when you interact with our Services. We may also use cookies to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on our Services and to customize and improve our Services. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted when you log off from the Services and close your browser. Although most browsers automatically accept cookies, you can change your browser options to stop automatically accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting cookies. Please note, however, that if you don’t accept cookies, you may not be able to access all portions or features of the Services. Some third-party services providers that we engage (including third-party advertisers) may also place their own cookies on your device.

If you would like to opt-out of the Technologies we employ on our sites, services, applications, or tools, you may do so by blocking, deleting, or disabling them as your browser or device permits.\n              </p>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n\n          <div className=\"terms\">\n            <div className=\"text\">\n              <h1>\n                Cookies and Interest-Based Advertising\n              </h1>\n              <p>\n                As noted above, you may stop or restrict the placement of cookies on your computer or remove them from your browser by adjusting your web browser preferences. Please note that cookie-based opt-outs are not effective on mobile applications. However, on many mobile devices, application users may opt out of certain mobile ads via their device settings. The online advertising industry also provides websites from which you may opt-out of receiving targeted ads from our data partners and our other advertising partners that participate in self-regulatory programs. You can access these, and also learn more about targeted advertising and consumer choice and privacy, at www.networkadvertising.org/ managing/opt_out.asp, or youronlinechoices.eu/ and aboutads.info/choices. You can also choose not to be included in Google Analytics here. To be clear, whether you are using our opt-out or an online industry opt-out, these cookie based opt-outs must be performed on each device and browser that you wish to have opted-out. For example, if you have opted-out on your computer browser, that opt-out will not be effective on your mobile device. You must separately opt-out on each device. Advertisements on third party websites that contain the AdChoices link and that link to this Privacy Policy may have been directed to you based on data collected by advertising partners over time and across websites. These advertisements provide a mechanism to opt-out of the advertising partners’ use of this information for interest-based advertising purposes.\n              </p>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"terms\">\n            <div className=\"text\">\n              <h1>\n                Questions?\n              </h1>\n              <p>\n                Please contact us at whril.com/support\n                if you have any questions about our practices or this Cookie Policy.\n              </p>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </section>\n    </main>\n    <Footer />\n  </div>\n);\n\nexport default Cookies;\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
